# Introduction #
This page guides through the installation process of NetS-X. NetS-X is a whole network environment. **Therefor NetS-X demands a system on it's own (either VM or physical machine).** NetS-X will use this machine completely.

There are two possible ways to install NetS-X, either via PXEboot or via Etherboot image. Further more the needed hardware is reduced one again.

PXEboot needs the configuration of a router, which supplies the client with theTFTP boot server address. The Etherboot can be initiated directly by using an image file on a booteable media.
# Needed Hardware #

  * one physical computer (CPU with virtualization extension)
  * two physical ethernet network ports
  * one DD-WRT capable router
  * one Alfa AWUS036H (500mW USB WLAN Adapter)
  * optional: one connector between Alfa and the router


# Installation topics #
The NetS-X VMserver installation is fully automatic via netboot and preseed. The Topology itself has to be setup manually.
